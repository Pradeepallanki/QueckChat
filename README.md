# QueckChat
Is a chat boat called pappuchat, Designed and developed in Android Studio ,using simsimi API.
I have used simsimi API, which had a trial of 7 days.
If you want to run this chatboat in your device, you need to login to simsimi site , generate the API key,
and in res->values->strings , replace the "simsimi" string value by the key you just generated.
